    "* **PassengerId**: a sequential integer number that uniquely identifies a passenger. This column represents a <u>discrete quantitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will not be considered an <u>independent variable</u>, but just a variable to axiliate in the aggregation functions.\n",
    "* **Survived**: informs if the passenger survived (1) or did not survive (0) the Titanic disaster. Although this column has numeric values, it represents a <u>nominal qualitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will be considered the <u>dependent variable</u>.\n",
    "* **Pclass**: informs the socio-economic status (1: upper, 2: middle and 3: lower) of a passenger on the Titanic. As in the Survived column, although this column has numeric values, it represents a <u>ordinal qualitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will be considered an <u>independent variable</u>. \n",
    "* **Name**:\tinforms the name of a passenger. It represents a <u>nominal qualitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will not be considered.\n",
    "* **Sex**: informs the sex (male or female) of a passagenger. It represents a <u>nominal qualitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will be considered an <u>independent variable</u>.\n",
    "* **Age**: informs the age of a passagenger. It is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5. It represents a <u>continuous quantitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will be considered an <u>independent variable</u>.\n",
    "* **SibSp**: informs the number of siblings (brother, sister, half-brother, brotherhood) and spouse (husband and wife) who have embarked with a passenger. It represents a <u>discrete quantitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will be transformed in a <u>nominal quanlitative variable</u> called **Alone** along with **Parch** to indicate whether a passenger travelled alone or with family.\n",
    "* **Parch**: informs the number of parent (mother, father) and child (daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson) who have embarked with a passenger. Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore Parch column is 0 for them. It represents a <u>discrete quantitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will be transformed in a <u>nominal quanlitative variable</u> called **Alone** along with **SibSp** to indicate whether a passenger travelled alone or with family.\n",
    "* **Ticket**: informs the ticket number used by passenger. The same ticket number can be used for more than one passenger, possibly indicating that the passengers traveled together or as a family. It represents a <u>nominal qualitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will not be considered because the new variable **Alone** will already indicate whether the passenger traveled alone or not.\n",
    "* **Fare**: informs the passenger fare. It represents a <u>continuous quantitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will not be considered because **Pclass** variable already indicate socio-economic status.\n",
    "* **Embarked**: informs the port (C: Cherbourg, Q: Queenstown, S: Southampton) where a passenger embarked. It represents a <u>nominal qualitative variable</u>. For the analysis, this variable will be considered the <u>independent variable</u>.\n",
