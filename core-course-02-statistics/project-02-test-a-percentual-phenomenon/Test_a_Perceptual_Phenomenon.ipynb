    "In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style=\"color:red\">RED</span>, <span style=\"color:blue\">BLUE</span>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style=\"color:green\">PURPLE</span>, <span style=\"color:purple\">ORANGE</span>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition."

    "- There is no significant time difference between tasks or incongruent task take less time than congruent task.

I will assume that the population distribution is normal. If the calculated t-score falls within critical region (blue highlighted area in the image below), I will reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "Now it’s your chance to try out the Stroop task for yourself. Go to [this link](https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/java/ready.html), which has a Java-based applet for performing the Stroop task. Record the times that you received on the task (you do not need to submit your times to the site.) Now, download [this dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9Yf01UaIbUgQXpYb2NhZ29yX1U/view) which contains results from a number of participants in the task. Each row of the dataset contains the performance for one participant, with the first number their results on the congruent task and the second number their performance on the incongruent task.\n",

The same applies to incongruent task in which the mean ($\\bar{x}_{i} \\approx 22.02$) and the median ($\\approx 21.02$) are close to. This shows that most of the data are more contained and close to the median (central data). In other words, there is not very divergent data regarding the central data. But I found two incongruent tasks' data that slightly exceeded the upper limit of outlier ($\\approx 32.05$). I highlighted them in <span style=\"color:red\">red</span> in the table below. The following table shows the congruent tasks' data and incongruent tasks' data sorted and divided by quantiles.\n",
