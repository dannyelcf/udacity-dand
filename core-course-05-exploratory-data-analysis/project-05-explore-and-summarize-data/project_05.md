Univariate Plots Section
========================

> **Tip**: In this section, you should perform some preliminary exploration of your dataset. Run some summaries of the data and create univariate plots to understand the structure of the individual variables in your dataset. Don't forget to add a comment after each plot or closely-related group of plots! There should be multiple code chunks and text sections; the first one below is just to help you get started.
