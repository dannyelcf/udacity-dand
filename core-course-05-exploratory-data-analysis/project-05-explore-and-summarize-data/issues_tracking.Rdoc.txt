Issues Tracking Data Set


Description
===========

This data set containing 22,125 observations of issues tracking and their history logs. It represents 5 years of project management which aimed maintenance and customization of many integrated systems. 


Usage
=====

issues <- read.csv("issues_tracking.csv", 
                   stringsAsFactors=FALSE, 
                   na.strings = "",
                   colClasses = c(...))

To load the data set with correct column classes see the 'Load Data Set' section 
in 'project_05.Rmd' file.


Format
======

A data.frame containing 22,125 rows and 24 variables. Of these 24 variables 
16 are about issue data and 8 about issue's logs. One issue can have zero or 
more history logs. Thus, one issue with two history logs has two rows in data 
set. In issue_* columns the data are repeated and in log_* columns the data 
are distinct (one for each issue log).

issue_id (integer):

	Internal identifier (in the database) of the issue. Its value uniquely 
	identifies an issue. The user of issue tracking system do not see this 
	identifier.

issue_number (integer):

	Identifier (in the database) of the issue. Its value uniquely identifies
        an issue. The user of issue tracking system see this identifier and use 
	it as reference.

issue_title (character):

	A small text that summarizes the content of the issue. Its value is in 
        Portuguese.

issue_type (unordered factor):

	A classifier for the issue. Its possible values (levels) are: 
	CUSTOMIZATION, DATA MIGRATION, MAINTENANCE, OTHERS

issue_creation_date (POSIXct):

	The date and time of creation of the issue. Its format is: yyyy-mm-dd 
	h:m:s.
	
        Example: 2016-12-15 15:07:32

issue_system (unordered factor):

	The name of the system for which the issue is. There are 10 possible 
	values (levels) for the system name.

issue_start_date (Date):

	The planning date to initiate an action on the issue. Its format is: 
	yyyy-mm-dd. 
        
        Example: 2016-12-20

issue_subsystem (unordered factor):

	The name of the subsystem for which the issue is. One system has one or 
	more subsystems. There are 77 possible values (levels) for the subsystem 
	name.

issue_deadline_date (Date):

	The planning date to deliver the issue. Its format is: yyyy-mm-dd. 
        
        Example: 2016-12-20

issue_created_by (character):
	
	The full name of person who created the issue.

issue_stakeholder (unordered factor):
	
	A classifier for the person who created the issue. Its possible values 
	(levels) are: COMPANY, CUSTOMER.

issue_status (unordered factor):
	
	A classifier for the issue which represents its status. There are 10 
	possible values (levels) for the status.

issue_time_spent (lubridate Period):

	Total time spent solving the issue. Its format is: hH mM sS or mM sS or 
	sS.
	
        Examples: 14H 12M 0S
                      42M 0S
                          0S

issue_priority_number (integer):

	A number that represents the priority of the issue. Its range value is 0 
	(highest) and 999 (lowest).

issue_progress (integer):

	A number representing the rate of progress of the completion of the 
	issue. Its range value is 0 (lowest) and 100 (highest).

issue_priority_scale (ordered factor):

	A classifier for the priority of the issue. Its possible are:
        SUSPENDED < LOW < MEDIUM < HIGH < URGENT < BLOCKING

log_build_info (character):

	The name of the new system version that will be deployed. It has two 
	formats:
        1) <system name>-<major>.<medium>.<minor>.ufg
        2) <system name>-<ref_major>.<ref_medium>.<ref_minor>.s_<sequence>.ufg
        For each system there is a reference system (trunk). Each system of a 
	client derivates from the reference system. His system version follows 
	the second format. The first format is an exception. It is used in 
	systems that break compatibility with version of reference system. 
	Currently, the first format is used only by SIGAA system. The others 
	systems use the second format.
        
        Example: SIGAA-4.1.14.ufg
                 SIPAC-4.19.1.s_27.ufg
                 
log_creation_date (POSIXct):

	The date and time of creation of the log in an issue. Its format is: 
        yyyy-mm-dd h:m:s. 
        
        Example: 2016-12-15 15:07:32

log_action (unordered factor):
	
	An activity/action taken to make progress in solving the issue. There are 
	14 possible values (levels) for the action.

log_status (unordered factor):
	
	The issue status at the moment of the log register. There are 34 possible
        values (levels) for the status.

log_progress (integer):

	A number representing the rate of progress of the completion of one 
	activity to the issue. Its range value is 0 (lowest) and 100 (highest).

log_time_spent (lubridate Period):

	Total time spent solving one activity to the issue. Its format is: hH mM 
	sS or mM sS or sS.
	
        Examples: 14H 12M 0S
                      42M 0S
                          0S

log_created_by (character):
	
	The full name of person who created the log in the issue.

log_svn_revision (integer):

	The number of SVN revision if activity involved changes in the source 
	code of the subsystem.
