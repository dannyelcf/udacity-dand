### Linear Regression Models

> Note: In this lesson, Solomon will be using a linear regression model to predict diamond price using other variables in the diamonds dataset. If you are not familiar with linear regression, you may want to take a break and go through [Lesson 18 of Udacity's Intro to Inferential Statistics](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud201/lessons/1309228537/concepts/1822138740923) course, which covers linear regression. When you're done, you'll be ready to come back and apply your new knowledge to the diamonds dataset!
