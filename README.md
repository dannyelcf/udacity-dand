## Projects
- [Project 01 \- Bay Area Bike Share Analysis](core-course-01-welcome-to-the-nanodegree/project-01-bike-share-analysis): This project aims to conduct an overview of what a data analyst does regularly. I investigated a raw dataset and shared my findings using a Jupyter Notebook. Using real-life data provided by [Bay Area Bike Share](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/), I determined differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more.
- [Project 02 \- Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](core-course-02-statistics/project-02-test-a-percentual-phenomenon): This project aims to review the basic concepts of statistics, including how to identify components of an experiment; how to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample; and how to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results.
- [Project 03 \- Investigate a Dataset](core-course-03-intro-to-data-analysis/project-03-investigate-a-dataset): This project aims to know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process; know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use; have practice communicating the results of your analysis; be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code; be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently; and know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing findings.
- [Project 04 \- Wrangle OpenStreetMap Data](core-course-04-data-wrangling/project-04-wrangle-openstreetmap-data): This project aims to assess the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity; parse and gather data from popular file formats such as .csv, .json, .xml, and .html; process data from multiple files or very large files that can be cleaned programmatically; and learn how to store, query, and aggregate data using MongoDB.
- [Project 05 \- EDA in an Issue Tracking System Data Set](core-course-05-exploratory-data-analysis/project-05-explore-and-summarize-data): This project aims to explore a data set containing 22125 observations of issues tracking and their history logs. The data set represents 5 years of project management which aimed maintenance and customization of many integrated systems ([SIG](https://docs.info.ufrn.br)) for the academic, administrative and human  resources management at the Universidade Federal de Goi√°s ([UFG](https://www.ufg.br)).
