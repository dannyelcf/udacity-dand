## Projects
- [Project 01 \- Bay Area Bike Share Analysis](core-course-01-welcome-to-the-nanodegree/project-01-bike-share-analysis): This project aims to conduct an overview of what a data analyst does regularly. I investigated a raw dataset and shared my findings using a Jupyter Notebook. Using real-life data provided by [Bay Area Bike Share](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com/), I determined differences in usage between commuters and tourists' ridership patterns, average duration of trips, and more.
- [Project 05 \- EDA in an Issue Tracking System Data Set](core-course-05-exploratory-data-analysis/project-05-explore-and-summarize-data): This project aims to explore a data set containing 22125 observations of issues tracking and their history logs. The data set represents 5 years of project management which aimed maintenance and customization of many integrated systems ([SIG](https://docs.info.ufrn.br)) for the academic, administrative and human  resources management at the Universidade Federal de Goi√°s ([UFG](https://www.ufg.br)).
